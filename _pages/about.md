Hi, I'm Weifeng Yu, also known as Ellery. I'm currently a student in the Master of Computer Science (MCS) program at the University of Virginia (UVA). I obtained my undergraduate degree from Wenzhou Kean University.

My research interests focus on using statistical methods and machine learning to analyze medical data. I am currently working as a research assistant under the guidance of Dr. Aiying Zhang in the NeuroBioinformatics Lab at UVA's School of Data Science. My current work involves conducting experiments with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using deep learning and traditional statistical methods. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the advancement of medical science by developing innovative computational tools and methodologies.

In my free time, I enjoy self-driving, watching football matches, and watching shows. My favorite football team is FC Barcelona, and my favorite show is Breaking Bad.

The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
